## What are the four key benifits of DevOps and how can we utilise them

- Ease of use, keeping everyone in the team on the same page can make it very easy for the development process as commuication
- Flexability, as DevOps works with both developers and operations skills can be utilised throughout the project 
- Robustness, continuos iteration on the project will result in a refined product as developers and testers are constantly improving the product
- Cost, DevOps provides effciency as issues are resolved early given the nature of continuos improvements. This can be 

## What is public cloud, Hybrid cloud and provate cloud

Public cloud is where your data cannot be access and stored else where such as AWS, Azure and Oracle.
Privte cloud is where data is stored in house such as having an on premis database, this may be used for applications that are very small scale and don't require a lot of data.
Hybrid is both Public and Private where some data are stored on premis and some data are stored else where such as AWS. An example of this is a bank which hold a lot of confidential data that can be stored on premis but some data are not confidential so the rest of that data can be stored in a blob storage in Azure.

## What is Monolith Architecture, 2 tier and Micro-services Architechture

A Monolith Architecture is where the backend and the frontend are worked on in the same envirionment. This can very useful for a small project with little complexites, for instance a blog about me.

A 2 tier Architecture is when the frontend and the backend are worked on in seperate environments, the frontend would request data or send data to the backend using an API. This can be used for larger applications.

Micro-services Architecture is when application is segmented to features which developed and deployed seperatly, this can be very useful if a specific service is not working or needes changing without effecting the product overall. Amazon uses this achitechture as it's really reliable for a large site with a large array of functionality.
